# Milestone Project Two - Handpicked Brighton

---

## Overview

This is a visitors guide to the best place to eat, drink and stay in Brighton. It provides the user with a selection of the best that the city has to offer for their time there. I wanted to highlight a 'locals' view of what's great and what they would tell visitors to do and experience it as a local would.

The illustration on the **HOME** page introduces the quirky and playful vibe that Brighton has. It is relaxed and fun. 

The main sea-green colour used on the website reflect the colour of the paint on the railings and lamp post etc around the city. It's very much the colour of Brighton, so adds a subtle visual signpost.

I created the Handpicked Brighton logo to be reflect the values of the city. The handwritten font is used to show the creative side and the 'handpicked' aspect as if it's a list written by an actual person. The San Serif is bold, stylish and confident. The two contrast and compliment each other.

## UX

The site is fully responsive, so can be viewed on all devices. This makes it fun and easy to plan your trip from a laptop or tablet from home, or from your phone on the move.

The Navigation is always visible allowing the user to click back and forth to each section easliy. The HOME page has three large buttons that reflect the Navigation bar to allow an alternative way to get around the site.

Each section (**EAT, DRINK and STAY**) have nine large visual buttons to choose from showing an enticing image of the location, it's name and a simple one word description to give the user help in deciding where to click.

Each button then takes you to a large map showing the location of the venue and a write-up describing it. At the end of the review is a simple button taking the user to the website, and another taking the user back to the main **EAT, DRINK, STAY** menus.

The footer is only visible on the **HOME** page so as not to crowd the simplicity of the other pages. It contains the site's social media.


### User Story

As a user, I want to quickly and easily find interesting and out of the way places to go in Brighton. 

I want to feel straight away that this site is my kind of style and I can trust it's recommendations.

**User 1: Day tripper:** The user here is only going to be in town for a day, so will want somewhere fun and interesting to have some lunch or dinner, and a few drinks before heading home. They won't want to waste time going places that aren't great. On the site they can discover some interesting places to really make the most of their day.

**User 2: Weekender:** The user here is down for a few days over the weekend. Having never been to Brighton before they are looking for an interesting experience to remember. They don't want to be stuck with the hordes of other day-trippers and toursist, they want to go where the locals go and see the 'real' Brighton.

**User 2: Local resident:** The user here is a resident of the city, that wants to find somewhere new that they just didn't know about.

## Features

The following click through pages follow the stylish, simple theme. Picking up the typograhy and colour. 

### Navigation bar

This holds all the links to the main sections of the site: **HOME, EAT, DRINK, STAY**. This allows the user to navigate quickly to the relevant section. the **Handwrittem Brighton** logo also acts as a link to the **HOME** page.


### Home

This is the first page a user comes to, and it has to make a big impact and entice them to want to go further. By having a funky, fun image on the **HOME** page, the user can feel that this is going to be a site with a cool vibe, which reflects the vibe of the city. If they want to tap into the feel of the city and get under its skin, this will be the place to go. The stylish logo and the contempory typography also give a feel of Brighton. The strap line of "YOUR GUIDE TO THE LOCAL SIDE OF BRIGHTON" tells the user just what the purpose of the site is. To make you feel like you're in-the-know.  

The three simple looking buttons, **EAT, DRINK,** and **STAY** immediately intice the user to go further and explore. Their simple message means that it's clear what they will show the user.

### Footer

The footer only appears on the **HOME** page, so not to overcrowd and complicated the following pages. It contains the site's social media.

### EAT/DRINK/STAY pages

These are the pages that show when the **EAT, DRINK,** or **STAY** buttons are clicked. They show an arrangement of nine handpicked venues to get food, drink or to stay. The large images give a visual climpse of what the venue looks like. The strong, stylish typography of the name of the venue with a one word classifications under it gives the user more clues about if it's the type of venue they are interested in. There is a simple, clean hover when the mouse glides over each box to show it is highlighted.

### Venue information pages

Once a venue is chosen from either **EAT, DRINK,** or **STAY**, the user is taken to a page which displays the information for that venue. It has a large custom map with a marker showing the location, a review of the venue and a link to their website. There is also a button to take you back to the **EAT, DRINK,** or **STAY** page you just came from.
