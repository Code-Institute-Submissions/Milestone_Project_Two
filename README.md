# Milestone Project Two - Handpicked Brighton
---
## Overview
This is a visitors guide to the best place to eat, drink and stay in Brighton. It provides the user with a selection of the best that the city has to offer for their time there. I wanted to highlight a 'locals' view of what's great and what they would tell visitors to do and experience it as a local would.

The illustration on the home page introduces the quirky and playful vibe that Brighton has. It is relaxed and fun. 

The main sea-green colour used on the website reflect the colour of the paint on the railings and lamp post etc around the city. It's very much the colour of Brighton, so adds a subtle visual signpost.

I created the Handpicked Brighton logo to be reflect the values of the city. The handwritten font is used to show the creative side and the 'handpicked' aspect as if it's a list written by an actual person. The San Serif is bold, stylish and confident. The two contrast and compliment each other. 

## UX

The Navigation is always visible allowing the user to click back and forth to each section easliy. The HOME page has three large buttons that reflect the Navigation bar to allow an alternative way to get around the site.

Each section (EAT, DRINK and STAY) have nine large visual buttons to choose from showing an enticing image of the location, it's name and a simple one word description to give the user help in deciding where to click.

Each button then takes you to a large map showing the location of the venue and a write-up describing it. At the end of the review is a simple button taking the user to the website, and another taking the user back to the main EAT menu.
