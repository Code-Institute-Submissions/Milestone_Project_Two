# Milestone Project Two - Handpicked Brighton
---
## Overview
This is a visitors guide to the best place to eat, drink and stay in Brighton. It provides the user with a selection of the best that the city has to offer for their time there. I wanted to highlight a 'locals' view of what's great and what they would tell visitors to do and experience it as a local would.

The illustration on the home page introduces the quirky and playful vibe that Brighton has. It is relaxed and fun. 

The main sea-green colour used on the website reflect the colour of the paint on the railings and lamp post etc around the city. It's very much the colour of Brighton, so adds a subtle visual signpost.

I created the Handpicked Brighton logo to be reflect the values of the city. The handwritten font is used to show the creative side and the 'handpicked' aspect as if it's a list written by an actual person. The San Serif is bold, stylish and confident. The two constrast and compliment each other.
